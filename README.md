# 🌱 Water Tasks

**Water Tasks** is a lightweight, responsive task management web app where each task is visualized as a seed that needs to be "watered." It helps you stay organized in a playful yet intuitive way. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no databases, just pure front-end magic with `localStorage` persistence.
